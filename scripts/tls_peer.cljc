(ns tls-peer
  "A Storj TLS peer built out of this library, mirroring `testdata/tls_peer.go`
  so the two can be pointed at each other.

      clojure -M:tls-peer serve /tmp/id-a 19443
      clojure -M:tls-peer dial  /tmp/id-b 127.0.0.1:19443 <expected-hex>
      clojure -M:tls-peer call  /tmp/id-b 127.0.0.1:19443 <expected-hex> \\
        /echo.Echo/Echo hello
      nbb --classpath \"$(clojure -A:cljs -Spath)\" scripts/tls_peer.cljc \\
        dial /tmp/id-b 127.0.0.1:19443 <expected-hex>

  In serve mode it prints `listening <port>` once bound, then accepts one
  connection, prints the peer's node id and exits — the same contract the Go
  peer follows, so CI can drive either side with either implementation.

  This is a test harness, not part of the library: nothing under `src/`
  requires it, and `scripts/` is not on `:paths`."

(defn satellite
  "A satellite, enough of one to introduce a node to.

  Not a stand-in for the real thing and not treated as one: it was written
  after a real satellite corrected three things about this library, and every
  one of them was invisible to `testdata/tls_peer.go` because that harness is
  *permissive* — it serves whatever rpc name it is handed over plain TLS. A
  counterparty written by the same hand as the client can only confirm what
  that hand already believes, so the value here is not agreement. It is that
  this one is **strict** about the things the real satellite turned out to be
  strict about:

  - the mux header is required, not optional
  - `/contact.Node/CheckIn` is the only rpc it answers; anything else is an
    error, which is how the wrong path would have been caught
  - `ping_node_success` is earned by actually dialling the address back, with
    the header, and getting an answer to `/contact.Contact/PingNode`

  What it is for: the whole check-in loop, on both runtimes, in CI, with no
  Docker and no network. What it is not for: deciding that this library is
  correct. That question is only answered by `storj-up`.

  JVM only. The dial-back has to happen before the response is written, and
  `host.rpc/serve-connection` calls its handler synchronously on cljs — a
  promise-returning handler would be a change to that contract rather than to
  this script. The node under test is unaffected: it runs on either runtime
  against this."

  This is the direction the library never had: `piecestore` decided what an

  was invisible, because a unary call also produces a message and its `:calls`
  entry arrives right behind it. Only a stream that never closes shows it.

  Sends limit, three chunks and `done`; then asks for the whole piece back
  and compares. A node that stored nothing, stored the wrong bytes, or
  answered the first chunk and stopped all fail here and in different ways."
