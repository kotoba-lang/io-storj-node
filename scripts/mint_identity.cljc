(ns mint-identity
  "Mint an identity with this runtime's crypto and lay it out on disk the way
  Storj does, so the reference implementation can be asked to load it.

  One file for both runtimes, because the point of running it twice is that
  the *library* is the same and the crypto underneath it is not — a JVM
  `KeyPairGenerator` and Node's OpenSSL bindings, producing an identity
  directory that `identity.FullIdentityFromPEM` then has to accept from
  either.

      clojure -M:mint /tmp/identity-jvm 16
      nbb --classpath \"$(clojure -A:cljs -Spath)\" scripts/mint_identity.cljc \\
        /tmp/identity-cljs 16
      cd testdata && go run verify_minted.go -dir /tmp/identity-jvm

  The four file names are Storj's. `ca.cert` and `ca.key` hold the authority;
  `identity.cert` holds the leaf followed by the CA; `identity.key` holds the
  **leaf's** key — the one that signs messages, while it is the CA's key the
  node is named after.

  Nothing in the test suite depends on the output; CI regenerates it every run
  rather than checking one in, because a fixed identity would only ever prove
  that one identity was well formed."
