(ns storj.node.transfer
  "Upload and Download as streams — the part `storj.node.service` could not
  hold.

  `service` answers one request with one response, which is the whole unary
  surface and none of the transfers. `storj.node.piecestore` has decided what
  an upload and a download are allowed to be since before there was anything
  to drive it: `begin-upload`, `accept-chunk`, `finish-upload`,
  `begin-download`, `sending`. This is what drives it, one message at a time.

  ## What this returns, and what it does not do

  `{:state s :out [...]}`, where each entry of `:out` is `{:message bytes}`,
  `{:end true}` or `{:error {:code n :message s}}`. No DRPC framing: that
  lives in `drpc.server` and `storj.node.host.rpc`, and a second place that
  knew how to write a packet would be a second place to get message ids
  wrong. Nothing here touches a socket either — a stream that ends is a value
  saying so.

  ## One message at a time is the point

  `drpc.server/feed` hands over `:messages` as they arrive rather than
  waiting for the client to finish, precisely so an upload does not have to
  be complete before a node can act on it. This uses that.

  It then buffers anyway, and the reason is worth stating rather than
  discovering: `IBlobStore/-put` takes a whole blob. So a piece is held in
  memory until `done`, which is a limit of that protocol and not of this
  layer or the transport — the streaming is real up to the store, and stops
  there. A node that must not hold a piece in memory needs `-put` to grow an
  offset, and then this changes in one place.

  ## V1 when the hash was checked, V0 when it was not

  A V1 piece file is a 512-byte header area then the body, and the header
  carries the uplink's hash, the uplink's *signature* over it, and the order
  limit. That is what lets a restarted node answer an audit: the attestation
  is the uplink's own, not the node's word for it.

  Which is exactly why an unverified hash must not be written into one. The
  signature in that header is the one thing a later reader cannot check
  without the limit's key, so a header built from a hash nobody verified is a
  file that looks proven and is not. So V1 is written when
  `finish-upload` reports `:hash-verified? true`, and a body — V0 — when it
  does not. The piece is still stored either way: refusing it would be
  refusing pieces over a signature nobody claimed to send.

  The two formats are told apart by filename, `.sj1` versus nothing, which is
  `piece/blob-path`'s `version` argument. A read tries V1 then V0, because a
  node really can hold both and looking only for the format this build writes
  would report an older piece as `no such piece` — which reads as data loss.

  ## A refused transfer is an error on that stream, not a closed connection

  A node is reachable by anyone who completed a handshake. An upload that
  fails admission ends *its* stream with an error and leaves every other
  stream on the connection alone, which is the same rule `service/handle`
  follows for the unary side."
