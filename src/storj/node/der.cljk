  "Just enough DER to read an X.509 certificate.

  Not a general ASN.1 library and not trying to be. A peer's certificate
  arrives as bytes and four things have to be got out of it — the public key,
  the signed body, the signature, and a couple of extensions — so this reads
  tag-length-value and nothing more. Values stay as bytes; nothing is
  interpreted here.

  ## Why parse at all rather than take it pre-parsed

  A host running TLS already has a parsed certificate, and this library could
  have asked for the pieces. But then the host is doing the part that decides:
  which bytes were signed, which key signed them, which extension said what.
  Those are the questions this library exists to answer, and handing them to
  every caller means every caller can answer them differently. Parsing here
  keeps the decisions in one place, and the seam becomes the one thing a host
  genuinely must own — `verify this signature`.

  ## Lengths

  Long-form lengths are bounded to four bytes, and indefinite-length encoding
  is refused outright. DER forbids indefinite length; accepting it would mean
  scanning for an end-of-contents marker, which is precisely the kind of
  attacker-steerable scan a certificate parser should not contain."
