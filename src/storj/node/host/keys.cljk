  "The reference `IKeyMaterial` — key generation, signing and entropy.

  The counterpart to `storj.node.host.verify`, and under `host` for the same
  reason: nothing here decides anything. It generates P-256 key pairs because
  `pkcrypto.GeneratePrivateKey` does, signs with ECDSA over SHA-256 producing
  the ASN.1 form `ecdsa.SignASN1` produces, and takes randomness from the
  platform's cryptographic source rather than from a seeded generator.

  A caller holding keys somewhere this cannot reach — an HSM, a remote
  signer, a file on a node that is already running — implements
  `IKeyMaterial` and never loads this namespace."
