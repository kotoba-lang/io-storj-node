(ns storj.node.host.verify
  "The reference `IVerifier` — the one seam this library cannot fill itself.

  Everything else in `storj.node.*` decides; this does. It is under `host`
  for that reason: it is the only namespace besides `storj.node.bytes` that
  touches a platform API, and a caller who wants a different one — an HSM, a
  remote signer, a test double — implements `IVerifier` and never loads this.

  ## Four schemes, and why two of them are RSA

  Storj presents more signature schemes than it looks like from any one file,
  and the differences are the kind that fail silently rather than loudly:

  | keyword              | key on the wire | where it appears                  |
  |----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
  | `:ecdsa-sha256`      | DER SPKI        | every current identity, and so    |
  |                      |                 | every satellite and node signature|
  | `:rsa-pkcs1-sha256`  | DER SPKI        | X.509 certificate signatures      |
  | `:rsa-pss-sha256`    | DER SPKI        | *messages* signed with an RSA key |
  | `:ed25519`           | 32 raw bytes    | uplink piece keys                 |

  The two RSA rows are the trap. `pkcrypto.signRSAWithoutHashing` signs with
  PSS and `verifyRSASignatureWithoutHashing` checks PSS, but a certificate
  carries `sha256WithRSAEncryption`, which is PKCS#1 v1.5. Same key, same
  hash, two paddings. A verifier that implements one of them and answers both
  questions with it does not report an error — it reports that a valid
  signature is invalid, on exactly the RSA identities old enough to be worth
  keeping working.

  The `:ed25519` row is the other one. Every other key here arrives as a DER
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo, but `storj.PiecePublicKey` is 32 raw bytes with no
  wrapper at all, because Go's ed25519 takes it that way.

  ## The salt length is computed, not detected

  Go signs PSS with `PSSSaltLengthAuto`, which on *signing* means the largest
  salt that fits and on *verifying* means detect whatever is there. Node can
  auto-detect; the JVM cannot. Taking each runtime's easiest path would leave
  them disagreeing about signatures a peer can send — the same shape of defect
  as `proto.wire`'s ten-byte varint, where one runtime threw and the other
  returned an error.

  So the salt length is derived from the modulus by the same arithmetic Go
  uses, in portable code, and handed to both. A signature with a shorter salt
  is refused on both rather than accepted on one.

  ## What a bad signature is

  A forgery is an expected input, not an error: `-verify` returns false for
  anything a peer can put on the wire, including a malformed key or a
  truncated signature. It throws only when the *caller* names an algorithm
  that does not exist, which is a bug in this process rather than a claim
  about a peer."
