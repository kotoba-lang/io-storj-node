(ns storj.node.id
  "Storj node identifiers.

  Every peer on the Storj network — satellite, storage node, uplink — is named
  by a 32-byte `NodeID` derived from its certificate authority's public key.
  On the wire it travels as raw bytes; everywhere a human or a config file
  sees it, it is base58check with a version byte:

      version(1) || id(32) || first-4-bytes-of-sha256d(version||id)

  base58-encoded. That is the same construction Bitcoin addresses use, and the
  same one `btc-crypto` implements for that purpose — Storj's `base58` package
  is a vendored fork of the btcutil one.

  ## The last byte is not part of the identity

  Byte 32 holds the **identity version**, and it survives none of the
  round trips one would expect. `NodeID.String()` zeroes it and moves it into
  the base58check version field; `NodeIDFromString` writes the version back
  into it. So `parse` of an encoded ID normalises that byte, and two IDs
  differing only there are the same node. This library reproduces that
  faithfully, including the part that looks like a bug: encoding a 32-byte
  value whose last byte is, say, `0x2f` and decoding it back does **not**
  return the same bytes. Storj behaves the same way, verified against its own
  encoder in `testdata/gen_vectors.go`.

  V0 is the only version that exists, and its number is 0.

  ## Difficulty

  A node ID is not free to choose. `difficulty` counts the trailing zero bits
  of the ID **excluding the version byte**, and the network requires a
  minimum, so generating an identity costs proof of work. That is what stops
  an attacker minting identities until some land next to a piece they want to
  attack.

  Skipping the version byte is not a detail: `Difficulty()` starts its scan at
  byte 31 and adds a byte's worth of bits for the one it skipped, so the
  smallest value it can report is 8. Counting all 32 bytes gives the same
  answer for every V0 identity — their version byte is zero, so it counts as
  eight trailing zeros either way — and a different answer the moment a
  version 1 ever exists.

  This is the one part of Storj's identity system that can be checked without
  the network, which makes it the one part that has real reference vectors
  here: the published satellite node IDs. `test/storj/node/id_test.cljc`
  decodes all four, and the checksums, lengths and difficulties in it were
  measured from the real strings rather than assumed.

  ## What this namespace does not do

  It does not *generate* identities and it does not verify that an ID actually
  belongs to a certificate chain. Both need the CA key and the peer TLS
  handshake, which live behind `IVerifier` and the transport this library
  does not own. See the README's scope section."
