(ns storj.node.protocols
  "The host seams.

  This library decides; it does not do. Everything with an effect — verifying
  a signature, reading a clock, touching a disk, holding a socket — is a
  protocol the host implements, for the same reason `sigv4` keeps `ICrypto`
  out of its pure layer: the shape of those operations differs per runtime,
  and a library that reaches for them directly can only run where it was
  written.

  There is no transport seam here, and that is deliberate rather than
  incomplete. A storage node speaks DRPC over TLS with Storj's own peer
  certificate rules, and none of that is implemented in this repo — see the
  README's scope section. Adding an `IConn` now would suggest otherwise."

(defprotocol IVerifier
  "Signature verification. Storj signs order limits and piece hashes with
  ECDSA over P-256 (satellites and nodes) and Ed25519 (uplink piece keys), so
  the algorithm travels with the key rather than being fixed here.

  `-verify` takes the public key as it appears on the wire, the exact bytes
  that were signed — `storj.node.pb/encode-*-for-signing` produces them — and
  the signature. It returns truthy or falsey, and must not throw for a bad
  signature: a forged message is an expected input, not an error."

(defprotocol IClock
  "The current time, in seconds since the epoch.

  A clock is a seam rather than a call to `System/currentTimeMillis` because
  every expiry decision in this library is a pure function of it, and a test
  that cannot move time cannot check an expiry boundary at all."
  (-now-seconds [this]))

(defprotocol IBlobStore
  "Piece storage, addressed the way `storj.node.piece/blob-path` names it.

  Deliberately small and deliberately not a filesystem: a node might keep
  blobs on disk, in object storage, or in memory for a test. `-put` takes the
  whole blob because this protocol does not model streaming — see the
  README's scope section on what a real node adds here."

(defprotocol IKeyMaterial
  "Key generation, signing and entropy — the write half of `IVerifier`.

  Minting an identity needs three things this library cannot invent: a key
  pair that did not exist a moment ago, a signature over bytes it assembled,
  and 128 random bits for a serial number. Randomness in particular is worth
  keeping behind a seam rather than reaching for a global: the proof of work
  is only work if the keys are unpredictable, and a test that wants a
  deterministic identity should have to say so explicitly rather than get one
  by accident.

  `-generate-keypair` returns `{:private <opaque> :public-spki <bytes>}`. The
  private half is whatever the host wants it to be and is never inspected
  here; the public half is a DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo, which is what a
  certificate carries and what a node id is derived from."

(defprotocol IKeyStorage
  "Getting a private key in and out of bytes.

  Separate from `IKeyMaterial` because the two answer different questions. A
  host that only ever mints and signs never needs this; a host holding keys in
  an HSM *cannot* implement it, and should not be forced to pretend by an
  interface that assumes every key can be exported.

  `-export-private-key` returns PKCS#8 DER, which is what Go writes and
  therefore what an `identity.key` file contains. `-import-private-key` takes
  the same, plus the encoding `storj.node.identity/parse-private-key-pem`
  reported — `:pkcs8` or the older `:sec1` — because a runtime's importer
  takes one or the other and mistaking them produces a key that is wrong
  rather than an error."
