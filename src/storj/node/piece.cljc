(ns storj.node.piece
  "Where a piece lives on disk, and how its header is framed.

  A storage node keeps opaque blobs. It never sees plaintext and never
  performs erasure coding — the uplink encrypts and erasure-codes before any
  node is contacted, and a node holds one share of a segment with no idea what
  the others contain. That is the whole reason the node side is tractable in a
  library like this while the uplink side is not (see the README).

  Two encodings that look interchangeable and are not:

  - A **piece ID printed for humans** is uppercase base32 — `PieceID.String()`
    uses the standard RFC 4648 table.
  - A **path on disk** is lowercase base32. `filestore.PathEncoding` is
    declared as `base32.NewEncoding(\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz234567\")`.

  Both were checked against Storj's own output rather than assumed: the
  vectors in `testdata/gen_vectors.go` print `PieceID.String()` in uppercase,
  and `storagenode/blobstore/filestore/dir.go` is where the lowercase table
  comes from. Getting them the wrong way round puts every piece in a
  directory the node will never look in again."
