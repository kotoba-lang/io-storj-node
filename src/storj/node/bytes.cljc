  "Byte plumbing, and the one place in this library that knows which runtime
  it is on.

  Everything else here speaks a single representation — a vector of unsigned
  ints 0-255, the convention the rest of this workspace's portable `.cljc`
  uses. `multiformats.core` does not: its digest wants a `byte-array` on the
  JVM and a `Uint8Array` on JavaScript, and its base58 decoder hands back a
  `byte-array` on one and a vector on the other. Rather than let that leak
  into every call site as a reader conditional, it is normalised once, here.

  A second implementation of SHA-256 would have been the alternative, and this
  workspace has just finished paying for six independent implementations of
  AWS SigV4 (ADR-2607254100). One adapter is not a duplicate."
