  "Check-in: the first thing a node says, and the only thing it has to say to
  be on the network.

  A node introduces itself to a satellite with `/node.Node/CheckIn`, and the
  satellite answers by dialling it back. Everything else a node does — storing
  pieces, settling orders — happens only if this succeeded.

  ## Nothing here is signed

  `CheckInRequest` has no signature field, which looks like an omission and is
  not. The satellite already knows exactly who is calling, because the
  connection underneath is mutual TLS and the peer's chain named a node id
  (`storj.node.tls/verify-peer`). Adding a signature would authenticate the
  same thing twice. It is also why a node that cannot present its identity
  cannot check in at all — there is no unauthenticated path in.

  ## What the response actually says

  `ping_node_success` is the satellite reporting whether it could **dial the
  node back** at the address the node claimed. A response can arrive with
  `ok?` false and no error at all: the call worked, the introduction did not.
  Reading only the transport result would report that as success, which is the
  one mistake this namespace exists to make hard — hence `admitted?` rather
  than a bare truthy check.

  ## Address

  The address is what the node claims it is reachable at, and the satellite
  believes nothing about it until the dial-back succeeds."

  "`node.NodeVersion`.

  **The timestamp is always emitted**, even when the caller has none.
  `node.proto` declares it `(gogoproto.stdtime) = true` and
  `(gogoproto.nullable) = false`, so gogo marshals a `time.Time` value rather
  than a pointer — and a zero `time.Time` is still a value. It goes out as
  Go's zero time, year 1, not the epoch.

  This was got wrong first: omitting the field produced a request eleven bytes
  shorter than the one `pb.Marshal` produces, which is the same trap the
  order-limit timestamps set and the same one this repo's own generator
  comment warned about."
