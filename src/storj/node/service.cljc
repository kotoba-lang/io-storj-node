  "What a node answers when it is asked.

  Everything before this was the node speaking. A storage node spends most of
  its life being spoken to — a satellite pings it, asks which pieces it has
  lost, hands it a bloom filter, tells it to delete things — and until there
  was a `drpc.server` there was nowhere to put any of that.

  ## The unary surface, and what is missing from it

  `Upload`, `Download` and `RetainBig` are streaming rpcs and are not here.
  What is here is what a satellite asks between transfers:

  | rpc | what it means |
  |---|---|
  | `/contact.Contact/PingNode` | are you reachable at the address you claimed |
  | `/piecestore.Piecestore/Exists` | which of these have you lost |
  | `/piecestore.Piecestore/Retain` | keep these, the rest is garbage |
  | `/piecestore.Piecestore/DeletePieces` | delete these |
  | `/piecestore.Piecestore/RestoreTrash` | put back what you were about to lose |

  A node that serves only these is not useful to an uplink and *is* useful to
  a satellite, which is the half that decides whether it stays on the network.

  ## PingNode is empty and that is the point

  `ContactPingRequest` and `ContactPingResponse` have no fields. The satellite
  is not asking anything; it is checking that the address in the check-in
  reaches a process that can complete a Storj handshake and answer. So the
  work is all in the layers underneath, and the handler is one line.

  ## An unknown rpc is an error, not silence

  A satellite calling something this build does not serve gets `Unimplemented`
  back. A server that ignored it would leave the satellite waiting for a reply
  that is never coming, and the timeout it eventually reports would say
  nothing about why."

  have, not their ids.

  beginning 0x08 would be reported as index 8. The two encodings are not
  distinguishable on the wire."

  means walking every piece this node holds for that satellite, which is
  hours of disk on a real node and is the caller's to schedule. The response
  is empty either way: `RetainResponse` has no fields, so a satellite learns
  nothing from it and is not waiting to."
