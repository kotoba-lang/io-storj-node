  "The Storj messages a storage node has to understand, and — the part that is
  easy to get wrong and impossible to debug — the exact bytes their signatures
  cover.

  Field numbers here were read out of the authoritative `.proto` files in
  `storj/common` (`pb/orders.proto`, `pb/piecestore2.proto`), not recalled.
  That distinction earned its place: a first pass written from memory had
  `limit` at 8, `action` at 9 and `satellite_signature` at 6, and all three
  are wrong. Nothing about those mistakes would have surfaced as anything but
  a signature that refuses to verify.

  ## Signing is not `remove the signature field`

  Storj does not sign the message it sends. `orders.proto` defines a second
  message for each signed type — `OrderLimitSigning`, `OrderSigning`,
  `PieceHashSigning` — with the same field numbers but different nullability,
  and `signing.EncodeOrderLimit` copies the wire message into it before
  marshalling. The comment in that file says why: gogoproto cannot round-trip
  `nullable=false` fields, so the signed form is a deliberately different
  serialization.

  What that means concretely, for a verifier:

  - The signature field is **absent**, not empty.
  - A timestamp that is present-but-zero on the wire is **dropped** for
    signing. The wire form declares those fields `nullable=false`, so gogo
    always emits them, even when unset; the signing form declares them
    nullable, so `if !limit.PieceExpiration.IsZero()` omits them. Keeping a
    zero timestamp is the difference between verifying and not.
  - The same holds for `deprecated_uplink_id` and `uplink_public_key`.
  - **Unknown fields are kept.** `EncodeOrderLimit` copies
    `XXX_unrecognized` across explicitly. A satellite running a newer schema
    than this node signs over fields this node has never heard of, and a
    decoder that dropped them would fail every signature. That is why
    `proto.wire` preserves them, and why this namespace works on decoded
    fields rather than a parsed struct.

  Fields are emitted in ascending field-number order, with anything outside
  the known schema last, which is what gogo's generated marshaller does."
