  "PEM, because an identity that exists is one on disk.

  `storj.node.mint` makes an identity; almost nobody needs that. A node
  operator ran `identity create` months ago and has four files, and the only
  useful thing to do with them is read them. That is what this is for.

  ## Strict where it matters, lenient where Go is

  `encoding/pem` skips anything before a `-----BEGIN` line, and so does this:
  identity files in the wild carry comments, and refusing them would refuse
  real identities. But base64 is decoded strictly, a closing label has to
  match its opening one, and **a `BEGIN` with no `END` is an error rather than
  a block quietly skipped** — Go's `pem.Decode` returns the rest of the input
  in that case, which for a caller reading a certificate chain means silently
  getting fewer certificates than the file contains.

  ## Why base64 is here

  Nothing in this workspace's byte libraries has it: `io-multiformats` carries
  base58 and base32 because those are what multihash and CID need. Sixty lines
  of table lookup is cheaper than a dependency, and it is checked against
  RFC 4648's vectors and against a PEM file Go wrote."
