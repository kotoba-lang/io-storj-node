(ns storj.node.identity
  "Peer identity: what a Storj certificate chain says, and whether to believe
  it.

  A Storj peer presents two certificates — a leaf it signs with, and the CA
  that signed the leaf and signed itself. The **CA's public key is the node's
  name**:

      node-id = sha256(sha256(DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo)) , last byte := version

  which is why a node cannot choose its id, and why the trailing zero bits of
  that hash are the proof of work `storj.node.id/difficulty` counts.

  ## What is decided here and what is not

  This namespace decides. It reads the chain, derives the id, checks the
  relationships and reports what is wrong. It does not do TLS and does not
  contain a signature primitive: `-verify` on `IVerifier` is the one thing the
  host must supply, and the host also owns the socket and the handshake.

  That split is not arbitrary. TLS termination differs on every runtime, but
  *which bytes were signed by which key* is the part that must not differ, and
  a host that answers it for itself can answer it differently.

  ## The extension that says how to hash, and does not

  `2.999.2.2` is documented in `peertls/extensions` as specifying \"how many
  times to hash the CA public key to calculate the node ID\". Nothing reads
  it — a search of `storj/common` finds only its declaration — so a node id is
  two rounds of SHA-256 today. `admit-chain` refuses a chain that carries it
  rather than ignoring it: a certificate asking for a different derivation is
  either from a future this build does not implement or an attempt to be
  hashed differently by different peers, and both are reasons to stop."
