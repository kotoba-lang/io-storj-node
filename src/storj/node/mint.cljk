  "Minting an identity: the proof of work, and the certificates it names.

  A node cannot choose its name. Its id is two rounds of SHA-256 over its CA
  public key, so the only way to get an id with a given number of trailing
  zero bits is to keep generating keys until one lands — which is what
  `difficulty` measures and what the network charges for admission.

  ## The loop is over keys, not certificates

  `identity.GenerateKey` derives the id from the key itself and only builds a
  certificate around the winner. Minting a certificate per attempt would be
  the obvious shape and would be enormously slower for no benefit: the
  certificate does not affect the id.

  ## Difficulty

  `Difficulty()` skips the version byte and credits a whole byte for it, so
  **8 is the smallest value the network can report and almost every key meets
  it on the first try** — the count only exceeds 8 once the byte before the
  version byte is zero, which is one attempt in 256. Each further 8 bits is
  another factor of 256, so a storage node's 36 is roughly 2^36 attempts and
  is why `identity create` runs for hours.

  Asking for 8 therefore proves nothing about this loop. The tests ask for 16.

  Nothing here parallelises: concurrency is the host's to add, and a portable
  library that spawned threads would only run where it was written.

  ## What is minted, and what is a decision

  Two key pairs and two certificates. The CA signs itself and signs the leaf;
  the leaf's key is the one that signs messages afterwards
  (`SigneeFromPeerIdentity` uses `Leaf.PublicKey`, while the id comes from the
  CA — an asymmetry worth not getting backwards). The shapes come from
  `storj.node.certificate`, the crypto from `IKeyMaterial`, and the decision
  about when to stop hashing is here."
