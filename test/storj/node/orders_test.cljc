  "Admission tests.

  The order limit used here is the real one from `testdata/gen_vectors.go`, so
  the fields being checked are in the positions a satellite actually puts
  them. Each test then damages exactly one thing — a different node ID, a
  passed deadline, a mismatched action — and asserts the specific reason comes
  back. A test that only asserted `not ok?` would pass just as well if the
  code rejected everything."
