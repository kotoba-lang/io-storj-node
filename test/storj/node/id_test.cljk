(ns storj.node.id-test
  "Node ID vectors.

  The four satellite IDs below are published by Storj as the addresses
  operators point their nodes at. They are used here rather than IDs this
  library generated, because a codec checked against its own output agrees
  with itself and nothing else. Every number asserted — the 37-byte decoded
  length, the version byte, the double-SHA-256 checksum, the difficulties —
  was measured by decoding those real strings, not assumed from the format
  description.

  The fifth vector comes from `testdata/gen_vectors.go`, which asks Storj's
  own `NodeID.String()` to encode the 32 bytes `0x10 … 0x2f`. It covers what
  the satellites cannot: an ID whose last byte is not zero, which is how the
  version byte's behaviour became visible at all. Encoding it and decoding it
  back does not return the input — Storj's encoder zeroes that byte and moves
  it into base58check's version field — and this test asserts the value Go
  produced rather than the one the format description suggests."
