  "The bloom filter, against every answer Storj's own gives.

  Not a round trip. A filter that decodes is not a filter that agrees: each
  probe takes a little-endian `uint64` modulo the table size, and that number
  does not survive a JavaScript double. Two implementations disagreeing about
  which bucket a piece lands in disagree about which pieces to delete.

  The seed is 200 on purpose. `initialConditions` divides the seed by 32 to
  choose a range offset, so an implementation that hardcodes the first one
  passes every test written with seed 0."
