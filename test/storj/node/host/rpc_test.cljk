  "The wiring between a socket and a call.

  Everything `storj.node.host.rpc` does that is worth testing involves a
  socket, so these use a real one on loopback rather than a fake: the JVM and
  Node socket APIs differ enough that a fake would be two fakes, and two fakes
  agreeing with each other prove nothing about either runtime.

  The happy path is also covered end-to-end in CI against a Go peer running
  `tlsopts` and `drpcserver`. What is here is the rest — the peer that sends
  an error, the peer that hangs up, the peer that answers on the wrong
  stream — which a healthy server never produces and which a client meets
  anyway."
