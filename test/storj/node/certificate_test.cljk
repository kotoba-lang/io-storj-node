  "Writing the certificates a Storj identity is made of.

  The first two tests are the ones that matter, and they are stronger than
  anything a writer usually gets: the fixture is a certificate Go's
  `x509.CreateCertificate` produced for a real `identity.NewCA`, and this
  rebuilds its signed body from the serial, key and extensions it contains
  and asserts the result is **byte-identical**. A certificate that merely
  parses, or that some verifier accepts, leaves room for a field encoded a
  legal-but-different way; equality does not."
