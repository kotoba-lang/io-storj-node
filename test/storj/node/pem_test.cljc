  "PEM, and the identity files it wraps.

  The test that carries the most weight is the shortest: the chain this
  library renders is **byte-identical** to what Go's `pkcrypto.WriteCertPEM`
  wrote for the same certificates. Everything else here is about what happens
  to a file that is not quite right, because that file is a real operator's
  identity and losing part of it silently is worse than refusing it."
