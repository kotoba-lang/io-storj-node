  "Certificate reading and chain admission, against a real Storj identity.

  The certificates below were produced by `testdata/gen_identity.go`, which
  calls `identity.NewCA` and `ca.NewIdentity` — the same code a node operator
  runs. They are checked in rather than regenerated, because generation is
  random; CI instead runs that program with `-verify`, which parses these same
  bytes with `storj.io/common` and asserts the node id, version and chain
  relationships this file claims. Holding the fixture to the reference
  implementation is a better check than holding it to a previous run of the
  generator.

  The node id in particular is not this library's own arithmetic: it was also
  reproduced independently with `openssl`/`shasum` before any of this code
  existed."
