  "The TLS decisions, without a socket.

  What is checked here is that the config says what `tlsopts.tlsConfig` says
  and that `verify-peer` refuses what it should. Whether a handshake actually
  completes is not something a unit test can answer honestly — that is the
  `tls` CI job, which runs this library against a peer built from Storj's own
  `tlsopts` in all four combinations."
