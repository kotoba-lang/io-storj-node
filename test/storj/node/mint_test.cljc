  "Minting: the loop, and the identity it produces.

  Two kinds of test, deliberately separated. The loop is checked against a
  fake `IKeyMaterial` handing out a known sequence of keys, so that *which*
  key it stops on is an assertion rather than a coincidence — a loop that
  accepted the first key would pass every test that only mints real
  identities, because at difficulty 8 the first key almost always qualifies.

  The identity itself is minted with real crypto and then read back by the
  same library that judges a peer's chain. The check that matters most is not
  here at all: `testdata/verify_minted.go` hands the result to
  `storj.io/common` and asks whether it is a Storj identity, because a parser
  agreeing with its own writer proves nothing."
